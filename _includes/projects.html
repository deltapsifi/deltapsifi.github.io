      <h3> Decoherence In Quantum Systems </h3>
      <p>
        <p>In Quantum Mechanics we define Quantum Systems by using the wavefunction (Ψ), which is a vector. For example :– |Ψ&gt; = a |0&gt; + b |1&gt; + c |2&gt; …… Here what we write in <strong>“ket”</strong> notation (|&gt;) are the possible quantum states and their coefficients are the probabilities for the particular states; these coefficients are complex numbers.</p>

      <h3> Fundamental Forces of Nature </h3>
      <p>
        <p>
          <strong>Forces</strong> or <strong>interactions</strong> are necessary for any change that takes place. From preventing atoms from collapsing to stabilising a star through fusion reactions, everything is a consequence of interactions between particles. In order for two particles to interact with each other there must be some “driving” or “mediating” particle that carries out the interaction. Such mediating particles are known as force carriers or <strong>bosons</strong>

      <h3> Parallel Universes </h3> 
      <p> 
        <p>A high energy particle was recently spotted over Antarctica and according to the scientists the particle blasted up through the ice of Antarctica setting off the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA), several other particles like this were also detected. These particles looked like ultra high energy neutrinos; however, ultra high energy neutrinos should not be able to pass through the Earth. In order to explain this there was a theory that these particles belonged to a parallel universe where things were the opposite of our universe: time moves backwards, left is right, and up is down.</p>

      <h3> The Fourier Transform </h3> 
      <p> 
        <p>In this article I will be giving you an insight into the Fourier Transform. We’ll be talking about the definition of The Fourier Transform later, first let’s talk about periodicity. Now what exactly is periodicity, it is the tendency of a particular phenomena to repeat at regular intervals. Periodicity is associated with symmetry.</p>
