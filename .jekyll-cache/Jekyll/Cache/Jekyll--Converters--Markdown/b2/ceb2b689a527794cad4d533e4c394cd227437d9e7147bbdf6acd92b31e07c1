I"¬<p>This post is the first in a series of posts about the Standard Model of Particle Physics, so stay tuned ğŸ˜‰. And remember this is just an introduction. â€œ<strong>What is matter made of ?</strong>â€ was the question that was keeping our ancient Greek and Indian philosophers up at night, until the origin of atomic theory. This theory is said to have been introduced by philosophers Leucippus and Democritus in Greece (around 5th Century BC) and is also said to have origins in ancient India. Then with time both experimental and theoretical proof led to the speculation regarding the existence of atoms and molecules and in the late 19th Century atoms were finally defined.</p>
