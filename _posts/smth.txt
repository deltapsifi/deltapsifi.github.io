Good Evening Ma'am
Me and my friend, as we mentioned the other day, haven't done the first few salt analysis experiments in the lab.
So will it be possible for you to allow us to perform the experiments in the lab under supervision if required.

Ok ma'am no issues. It would be a great help if you can accomodate us in the other part of our class which has chemistry lab period.
